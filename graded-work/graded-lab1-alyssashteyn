=== Note: the scoring formula is given here.

The following scoring formula has the effect of scaling style by
correctness. This is so a student cannot, for example, write only one
function out of six and earn full style points.

Let c = correctness points.
Let p = correctness percentage.
Let s = style points.
The total score is (c + p*s), rounded to the nearest integer.

For example, if a student earns 32/64 correctness points and 24/36
style points, the total score is 32 + 0.5 * 24 = 32 + 12 = 44.
